After struggling a lot with styling my previous project , I finally made a responsive simple webpage .
Things I did to make responsive
- Web-pages are initially responsive its us that breaks its responsiveness
- Do not set strict height on your element .
- Try using %,em or rem in place of px
- Make classes that are reusable as much as possible
- Try to recognise common layouts that exist throughout your page
- Making mobile first layout helps a lot because it separate your styling properties and layout properties.
